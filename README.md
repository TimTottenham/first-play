Guidelines
==========

In general, characteristics of a good README included:

Brief or no discussion of concepts which were stated in lecture (eg, how an AVL tree does its rotations)
Succinct discussion of important design issues that were faced, the solution that was decided upon, as well as the rationale behind the decision.
For the Shakespeare/Bacon or extra credit analyses, it was important to state:
the problem/question they were answering,
any relevant data that they collected,
an answer to the stated question, which is justified by the collected data.
